# Building A Tree - From Scratch
To go beyond simply calling libraries with data structures all ready built. To go the extra step and truly understand how everything works, by simply building it from scratch

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  C++

This was really challenging as everything built off eachother. There was a lot of code. A lot of lines. Messy and poor coding habits only made it harder. This was also a group project. So I constantly had to create and regulate some coventions that worked for all of us. This Project taught me how to lead and code in a way that was optimal.
## Optimizations

More test cases. Clean up the code. More comments and a cleaner user experience for the interface.

## Lessons Learned:

We walk on the shoulders of those who built insane things for us to simply code one liners. There is so much that happens that we do not even consider because those before us built so much, so that we would not have to.
