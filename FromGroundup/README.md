A repository for a structures project. A project for the creation of data structures that enhance data manipulation


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  C++
A project that tackled my understanding of data structures and clean coding habits.
## Optimizations

I built everything off a linked list. I built a stack and queue using a linked list container that behaved like them. I would definitely just start from scratch rather than depending on the original linked list built.

## Lessons Learned:

You can do anything with data as long as it is consistent and makes sense. It is important to keep track of variables and where you are storing information so it does not get lost .
